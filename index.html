  <h1>  My Journey </h1>
  </center>

  <h4>My Journey on to becoming a web developer so far is challenging but that didnt scare me one bit, It made me improve to try my best into this tech industry and perfom the best and stunning websites to gain my clients attention and strive to teach more young developers in the future. What i have learned so far within this program is the basis of whats it is to come when it comes to building a website and its to write html codes that will show how they will perform, adding colors to each text using CSS Coding and elements, making tables and forms for our clientes and users like myself to test and use, creating links, posting videos and audios to have my clients enjoy the website and to keep them intrugied. What i found interesting is that everytime i put a code in and include a background within the coding it just shows the beauty of what content im willing to bring in this website. I hope to bring the best out of myself and i hope you enjoy reading my Jounrey now you to can also sign up to be part of this journey i've experience and one day you will excel at my skills as well.</h4>
